The http:get("foo") line in the test module, is it actually doing anything?
Or isn't this just bypassing everything else in the module?

NOPE:
If I print out what the test program is getting from the server I get:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

THIS IS THE RESPONSE

So ... the get() function in the http module is just returning a formed GET XXX string that is then sent to the server.
