Atomic multicast

Nodes with leader
Send message to leader - leader does basic multicast to all - if leader dies elect new one

Node join - send request to any node - leader decides when to include it and send a new view of system to all nodes

Application layer has a group process that communication goes through - no views go to the application layer

View synchrony
"messages are delivered in a view"
For all messages in a view we guarantee:
- FIFO - in the order they were sent by the sending node
- Total order - all nodes see the same sequence
- Reliable - If a correct node delivers a message all correct nodes deliver the message

Correct node:
Does not fail during a view, i.e. it survives to install the next view
(a node will fail only by crashing and will then never be heard from again)

NOTE:
Not guaranteed that a send message is delivered. Async sending and no ACKs.
If failing leader then a sent message might disappear.
