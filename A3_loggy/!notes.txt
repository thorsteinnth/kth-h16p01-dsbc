Test run

log: na john {received,{hello,78}}
log: na ringo {sending,{hello,79}}
log: na paul {sending,{hello,24}}
log: na george {sending,{hello,78}}

There is no way to differentiate between the sent message and the received message except for the random number
in the message.

Can see that john received message 78 before george sent message 78

TODO: Experiment with the jitter and see if you can increase or decrease (eliminate?) the number of entries that are wrong.

Lamport time:

log: 1437 george {received,{hello,7}}
log: 1437 paul {sending,{hello,43}}
log: 1436 john {sending,{hello,7}}

Here we have the same message (random number 7).
Received before it is sent.
Lamport clocks give us partial order, so we can see that this message sending event (message 7) is out of order in the logger.

TODO: What is always true and what is sometimes true? How do you play it safe?
