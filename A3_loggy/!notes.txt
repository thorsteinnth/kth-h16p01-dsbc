Test run

log: na john {received,{hello,78}}
log: na ringo {sending,{hello,79}}
log: na paul {sending,{hello,24}}
log: na george {sending,{hello,78}}

There is no way to differentiate between the sent message and the received message except for the random number
in the message.

Can see that john received message 78 before george sent message 78

TODO: Experiment with the jitter and see if you can increase or decrease (eliminate?) the number of entries that are wrong.
