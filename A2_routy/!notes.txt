Wasn't updating my map when I added a new interface
routy:test() got me this:

Two routers connected to each other.
But to route to themselve they first send it to the other one. Don't know that they are linked to themselves.
The gateway nodes should be part of the map.

When we update the routing table we do:
Table1 = dijkstra:table(interfaces:list(Intf), Map),

Our interfaces are our gateways, but the Map is never updated to show myself and what I am connected to

                                          [{lund,#Ref<0.0.6.120>,

                                          [{lund,lund},{stockholm,lund}],

                                          [{stockholm,stockholm},
                                           {lund,stockholm}],
                                          [{stockholm,[lund]}]}
ok

I code to update the map with my interfaces, so the map shows what cities I am connected to
Then I get:

(sweden@192.168.1.8)3> routy:test().

        Table: [{stockholm,stockholm},{lund,stockholm}]
        Map: [{lund,[stockholm]},{stockholm,[lund]}]
ok

The map is correct, BUT ... the routing table still shows that if I want to route to myself, I should route to the
other city first, which I guess is not correct.

For lund we have:
Table: [{stockholm,stockholm},{lund,stockholm}]
send to lund ... route to stockholm first

Am I supposed to have myself in the map? Isn't like that in the code given in the assignment document.

Don't think this matters. We never route to ourselves. Don't look in the routing table if the message is meant for us.

NOTE:
Routers of course have to connect to each other.
A-B ... A has B in its interfaces, B has A in its interfaces.
When you send broadcast messages you send them out on all your interfaces.
